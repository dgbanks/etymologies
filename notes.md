### notes for MERN App

#### Server Side Architecture
* Node: JS runtime used to execute code outside browser
* Express: library that uses Node runtime, makes dealing with HTTP traffic easier
  * looks at the requests and decides what code will handle the response

#### authentication theory
* HTTP is stateless, information between requests is not shared

#### MongoDB
* mongoose.js: library for working with MongoDB
* MongoDB is schema-less!
* collections contain many records; records contain many key-value pairs
* A model class in Mongoose represents an entire collection in MongoDB (instances are records)
